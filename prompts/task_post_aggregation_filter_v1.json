Stakeholder roles and their alignment with the user's role\n2. Project importance tier and typical work patterns for this role\n3. Activity level: meeting frequency, mention volume, temporal engagement\n4. Domain alignment: Is this the kind of work this person would be involved with?\n5. Reality check: Does the aggregation metadata suggest this is a real project or noise?\n\nRESPOND ONLY WITH VALID JSON (no preamble, no markdown):\n\n{\n  \"is_relevant\": true,\n  \"confidence\": 0.87,\n  \"reasoning\": [\n    \"Reason 1: stakeholder and role alignment\",\n    \"Reason 2: project importance and domain fit\",\n    \"Reason 3: activity patterns and engagement\",\n    \"Reason 4: reality assessment\"\n  ],\n  \"recommendation\": \"INCLUDE or EXCLUDE\"\n}\n\nGUIDANCE FOR SCORING:\n- 0.90-1.00: Highly relevant, authentic project clearly aligned with role\n- 0.75-0.89: Relevant project, good alignment, minor uncertainty\n- 0.50-0.74: Possibly relevant but some concerns (unclear role fit, low activity, or potential noise)\n- 0.25-0.49: Probably not relevant (misaligned with role, suspicious patterns, or aggregation noise)\n- 0.00-0.24: Clearly not relevant (unrelated to role, evidence of spam/noise)\n\nEXAMPLE EVALUATION:\nIf user is \"IT Solution Architect\" and project is \"Cloud Migration Initiative\" with PM + Staff Engineer as stakeholders, high criticality, 24 mentions, 8 meetings over 10 weeks → HIGH confidence (0.85+)\n\nIf user is \"IT Solution Architect\" and project is \"Lunch Planning Committee\" with casual mentions, low importance tier, 3 emails over 2 months → LOW confidence (0.25)\n\nIf user is \"IT Solution Architect\" and project has inconsistent stakeholder roles, unclear purpose, only 1-2 mentions → MEDIUM-LOW confidence (0.40)",
