Your goal is to identify projects, initiatives, and programs mentioned in the email, with confidence scores and reasoning.\n\n---\n\nEMAIL TO ANALYZE:\nSubject: {subject}\nFrom: {sender_email}\nTo: {recipients}\nDate: {delivery_date}\nBody: {body_snippet}\n\n---\n\nTASK: Extract all projects mentioned. For each project:\n1. What is the project name? (Use exact name if stated, infer if implicit)\n2. How confident are you (0.0-1.0)? (explicit mention=high, inferred=medium, ambiguous=low)\n3. What evidence supports this?\n4. Is this a top-level project or a subcomponent?\n\nRESPOND ONLY WITH VALID JSON (no preamble, no markdown backticks):\n\n{\n  \"extractions\": [\n    {\n      \"extraction\": \"Project Name\",\n      \"type\": \"project|initiative|program|unclear\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.85,\n      \"signal_strength\": \"high|medium|low\",\n      \"reasoning\": [\n        \"Evidence 1: explicit mention in subject\",\n        \"Evidence 2: mentioned in context of deliverables\",\n        \"Evidence 3: specific dates or milestones tied to it\"\n      ],\n      \"flags\": []\n    }\n  ],\n  \"most_likely_project\": \"Primary Project Name\",\n  \"note\": \"Any ambiguities or uncertainties here\"\n}\n\nCONFIDENCE GUIDELINES:\n- HIGH (0.85-1.0): Explicit name, multiple mentions, meeting context\n- MEDIUM (0.50-0.85): Inferred from context, single mention, no explicit name\n- LOW (0.0-0.50): Passing reference, unclear scope, could be other project\n\nEDGE CASES:\n- No project mentioned? Return empty extractions array, set most_likely_project to null\n- Ambiguous (could be project OR routine discussion)? Flag it, set low confidence\n- Subcomponent (feature of larger project)? Note it, flag as \"SUBCOMPONENT\"",
