CRITICAL: Strategic priority, affects roadmap, requires executive approval, blockers for other work\n2. EXECUTION: Active project work, development/implementation, progress toward milestones\n3. COORDINATION: Meetings, syncs, status updates, cross-team alignment (overhead but necessary)\n4. FYI: Information-only, awareness, nice-to-have updates\n5. NOISE: Spam, mailing lists, auto-generated, not work-related\n\nAssign a weight multiplier:\n- CRITICAL: 5.0x (this counts as 5x effort)\n- EXECUTION: 2.0x (active work, concrete output)\n- COORDINATION: 1.0x (overhead, flat weight)\n- FYI: 0.5x (light awareness)\n- NOISE: 0.0x (ignore)\n\nRESPOND ONLY WITH VALID JSON (no preamble, no markdown backticks):\n\n{\n  \"importance_tier\": \"CRITICAL|EXECUTION|COORDINATION|FYI|NOISE\",\n  \"tier_confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"weight_multiplier\": 2.0,\n  \"reasoning\": [\n    \"Reasoning 1: Observable signals (language, urgency, decision-making)\",\n    \"Reasoning 2: Context (part of larger project, mentions deliverables, etc.)\",\n    \"Reasoning 3: Stakeholder pattern (decision makers present, initiator role)\"\n  ],\n  \"flags\": []\n}\n\nSIGNAL PATTERNS:\n- CRITICAL: \"urgent\", \"blocking\", \"decision needed\", \"executive sponsor\", \"blocker\"\n- EXECUTION: \"implementation\", \"on track\", \"code review\", \"testing\", \"deploy\"\n- COORDINATION: \"sync\", \"standup\", \"FYI\", \"informing\", \"status\"\n- FYI: \"thought you'd like to know\", \"for awareness\", \"cc'd for visibility\"\n- NOISE: \"automated report\", \"mailing list\", \"newsletter\", \"spam folder patterns\"\n\nEDGE CASES:\n- Email with mixed signals (some critical, some coordination)? Tier to highest signal\n- Unclear importance? Default to EXECUTION, flag as \"uncertain\"",
